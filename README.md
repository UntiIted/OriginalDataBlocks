# OriginalDataBlocks
Storing changes made to blocks and block types of base game.

Do note that il2cpp can mess with types and one issue i'm aware of that can be seen in typelist - Dictionary types are printed even though they're not actually part of datablocks.

### :warning: DataBlocks obviously contain spoilers
Files can spoil unreleased and new content such as enemies and terminal logs as well as passwords.
